# VerticalX Recommendation System
<div style="text-align: justify">
VerticalX is an information filtering system that uses natural language processing techniques to make content based recommendations for movies based on the users interest. 
The project uses the TMDb dataset. The investigating Dataset contains information about 10k+ movies collected from TMDb. The project is deployed over Heroku.

This project was developed in April 2022 as a standalone project and is is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0. The web resources and pull requests are maintained by Ashwin Raj. Learn more about VerticalX recommendation systems here.

# SubDirectories and Constraints
### Dependencies
 - **Website:** StreamLit, Heroku, Requests Library (for sending HTTP/1.1 requests in Python)
 - **Machine Learning Model:** Pandas, NumPy, Natural Language Toolkit, Scikit-Learn, Pickle

### Files and Folders:
- **Assets:** This folder contains the Jupyter notebook for the NLP Model, and other visual resources
- **Data:** This folder contains the dataset used for training the model. It contains 10,000 datapoints
- **Pickle:** This sub-directory contains the serialized python-dump. Similarity.pkl file is not included
- **app.py:** This is the generic entry point for the python application, and contains the source code 
- **Procfile:** This file specifies the commands that are to be executed by the Heroku app on startup

All relevant updates and stable versions are made available in the ~/stableVersion sub-directory. Some subdirectories may be sensitive for the project and may trigger 
review requests, when pull requests touch these files. Github handles with commit rights made available in the 
[~/Template Files/CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/ashwinraj-in/Kiwi/blob/main/Template%20Files/CODEOWNERS) are responsible for reviewing such changes

# User Installation and Source Code
The recommendation model is wrapped in a website, esigned using streamlit and is hosted on Heroku. The working demo can be found here: verticalx.herokuapp.com. 
For users to  run the application in their local workspttions, the users must first download all resources, and requirements. To recommend  movies, the user shall  select a movie from the dropdown list, or search a movie in the list and hit the recommend button. Five movies similar to the users selection will be recommended by the application.

To run the streamlit application on a local computer, open the terminal, install streamlit and then type the command:
```
streamlit run app.py
```
The command might take 30 seconds before opening the streamlit app on the browser tab  with Local url: http://localhost:8501

### Directory Structure
VerticalX's development takes place on GitHub. Submit any bugs that you may encounter to the issue tracker with a reproducible example, demonstrating the problem in accordance with the [issue template]() present in contributing files.

To run the application, first download the required resources or clone this repository. Streamlit must be pre-installed for the application to run. The files and folders important for the website to run includes: app.py, procfile, setup.sh, pickle-dumps, the  dataset and the Jupyternotebook. Similarity.pkl could not be included in this repository as it exceeds GitHub's file size limit. However, the file can be re-generated by the user while running the Jupyter notebook.


### Clone the repository
To start contributing to the project, clone the repository into your local system subdirectory using the below git code:
```
git clone https://github.com/ashwinraj-in/Kiwi.git
```
Before cloning the repository, make sure to navigate to the working directory in your command line interface and ensure that no other folder with the same name exists. Other ways to clone the repository includes using a password protected SSH  key or by using the Git CLI. Changes  may also be performed by opening the repository using GitHub Desktop

### Edit the Source Code and Make Desired Changes
To be able to make changes to the source, you may need to install and use a python IDE such as PyCharm, Microsoft VisualStudio and/or any other python interpreter. You will also require Jupyter notebook  for working with the code snippets. The posters are fetched using the TMDb API. You may create your own API by logging into TMDb developers. Ensure that you follow the coding standards while making the appropriate changes

### Submitting a Pull Request
Before opening a Pull Request, it is recommended to have a look at the full contributing page to make sure your code complies with all the pull request guidelines. Please ensure that you satisfy the [~/checklist](https://github.com/ashwinraj-in/Kiwi/tree/main/Template%20Files/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE) before submitting your PR.

Navigate to this subdirectory & check status of all files that were altered (red) by running the below code in Git Bash:
```
git status
```
Stage all your files that are to be pushed into your pull request. This can be done in two ways - stage all or some files:
```
git add .            // adds every single file that shows up red when running git status
```
```
git add <filename>   // type in the particular file that you would like to add to the PR
```

Commit all the changes that you've made & describe in brief the changes that you have made, using this command:
```
git commit -m "<commit_message>"
```
Push all of your updated work into this GitHub repo in the form of a Pull Request by running the following command:
```
git push origin main
```
Pull requests are reviewed on a rolling basis. Your understanding is appreciate during this review process.
