# VerticalX Recommendation System

VerticalX is an information filtering system that uses natural language processing techniques to make content based recommendations for movies based on the users interest. 
The project uses the TMDb dataset. The investigating Dataset contains information about 10k+ movies collected from TMDb. The project is deployed over Heroku.

This project was developed in April 2022 as a standalone project and is is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0. The web resources and pull requests are 
maintained by Ashwin Raj. Learn more about VerticalX recommendation systems here.

# SubDirectories and Constraints
### Dependencies
 - **Website:** StreamLit, Heroku, Requests Library (for sending HTTP/1.1 requests in Python)
 - **Machine Learning Model:** Pandas, NumPy, Natural Language Toolkit, Scikit-Learn, Pickle

### Files and Folders:
- **Assets:** This folder contains the Jupyter notebook for the NLP Model, and other visual resources
- **Data:** This folder contains the dataset used for training the model. It contains 10,000 datapoints
- **Pickle:** This sub-directory contains the serialized python-dump. Similarity.pkl file is not included
- **app.py:** This is the generic entry point for the python application, and contains the source code 
- **Procfile:** This file specifies the commands that are to be executed by the Heroku app on startup

All relevant updates and stable versions are made available in the ~/stableVersion sub-directory. Some subdirectories may be sensitive for the project and may trigger 
review requests, when pull requests touch these files. Github handles with commit rights made available in the 
[~/Template Files/CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/ashwinraj-in/Kiwi/blob/main/Template%20Files/CODEOWNERS) are responsible for reviewing such changes

# User Installation and Source Code
The recommendation model is wrapped in a website, esigned using streamlit and is hosted on Heroku. The working demo can be found here: verticalx.herokuapp.com. 
For users to  run the application in their local workspttions, the users must first download all resources, and requirements The files and folders important for 
the website to run includes: app.py, procfile, setup.sh, pickle-dumps, the  dataset and the Jupyternotebook. Similarity.pkl could not be included in this repository 
as it exceeds GitHub's file size limit. However, the file can be re-generated by the user while running the Jupyter notebook

To run the streamlit application on a local host, open the terminal, install streamlit and then type the command:
```
streamlit run app.py
```
The command might take 30 seconds before opening the streamlit app on the browser tab  with Local url: http://localhost:8501
